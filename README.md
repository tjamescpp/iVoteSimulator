Object-Oriented Programming - Assignment 1

In this programming assignment, you will build a Java-based simulation tool based on the live
poll idea (mentimeter) we used during the class. This is going to be a pure desktop-based
console program, WITHOUT web interactions or graphical UIs required.

The program simulates a poll of students who answer various questions. To demonstrate the program, students and answers are randomly generated. There are 3 single choice questions and 1 multiple choice question. Only 1 answer per student is provided for the single choice questions, and 2 answers are provided for the multiple choice question. Students and their answers are stored in a hash map. The output displays information about the questions, answers to choose from, counts for each answer, and the correct answer.
